This assessment will help you choose the right equipment and plan for your network.</p><h3 class=\\\"text-lg\\\"><strong>Step 2: Choose the Right Router</strong></h3><p>Selecting the right router is crucial for a strong home network.

Set a strong password for your router to prevent unauthorized access. Enable WPA3 encryption for a higher level of security. Also, change the default login credentials to protect your router's settings.</p><h3 class=\\\"text-lg\\\"><strong>Step 5: Create a Guest Network</strong></h3><p>If you have guests frequently, consider setting up a guest network.
